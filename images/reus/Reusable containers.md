# Reusable To-Go Containers and Why You Should "Choose to Reuse"
#### By Kelsey Bales
<br>

 A couple months ago, all 4 of my roommates came back on the same day with a reusable to-go container instead of their usual compostable to-go boxes.  They said they felt "pressured" into choosing the reusable box,  and I honestly was glad that I wasn't roped into accepting a reusable container because, as I—quite notably, <i>incorrectly</i>—thought at the time, who wants to deal with that? But as the condensation from my steaming pasta sauce began slowly soaking my legs through the compostable to-go box I had sitting on my lap, I began to rethink my opinion. I got one a couple days later to try it out, and since then, I haven't turned back.

### What Are Reusable To-Go Containers?
At Virginia Tech, the reusable to-go containers are part of our overall "<a href="https://www.dining.vt.edu/about/Reusable_To_Go_Program.html">Reusable To-Go Program</a>," which is the product of a partnership between VT Dining and the Student Government Association, Housing and Residence Life, and the Office of Sustainability.  They are about the same size and shape as the compostable to-go boxes, but are instead plastic (and green).  They even have an inscription on the top to remind you to "Choose to Reuse."

### How Does It Work?
The reusable containers are offered at West End, Owens, and Turner, and return kiosks exist at West End, Owens, Turner, and Hokie Grill.  Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:
<ol>
<li>Ask for a reusable to-go container when you order food at the dining hall.</li>
<li>Eat!  You can eat your food at the dining hall, or you can bring the container with you to go.</li>
<li>Empty and rinse out your container before returning it.</li>
<li>Bring your container to a return kiosk and follow the instructions on the machine to complete your return.  You can also return the containers at a dish return station.</li>
<li>Repeat!</li>
</ol>




### Why You Should "Choose to Reuse"
So what's so good about reusable to-go containers?  They help decrease the amount of waste we cause by getting our food-to go, *and* they save you money!  Regular compostable containers—which, by the way, are often not composted and instead end up in landfills—still require waste disposal actions, unlike the reusable containers that are washed and reused. Compostable to-go boxes cost you 20 cents apiece for one use, compared to reusable boxes, which can be used about 300 times and are completely free for students, faculty, and staff to take out up to 3 containers, if you return them!  That means your meal plan money can be spent more on actual food and less on compostable containers.

When you hear "reusable to-go container," what do you think?  Like I said earlier, I used to think that they were inconvenient and nothing more than a hassle.  But once I started using them, I realized how great they are.  They save you money, they decrease the amount of landfill waste <i>and</i> waste in your trash cans, and they don't let your food soak through!  Sounds like a great offer to me.  And now, dining halls even offer reusable to-go water bottles!  Food *and* water—what more could you need?

If your school doesn't have a reusable to-go container program, you can work with the Post-Landfill Action Network (PLAN) to start one through this <a href="http://www.postlandfill.org/to-go-guide/">submission form</a>.  If you want to learn more about exactly what this would require, you can find further information in PLAN's "Guide to Setting Up To-Go Container Programs on Your Campus" <a href="http://www.postlandfill.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/togoguide_updated_9_15_AS.pdf">here</a>.

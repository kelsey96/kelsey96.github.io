# The Meat Industry
### By Kelsey Bales

Did you know that we consume 35 million cows, 115 million pigs, and 9 billion birds <i>per year</i>?  And that 50 billion land animals are slaughtered <i> per year</i>?  When I found that out, I was appalled.  I mean, fifty BILLION?  I discovered this recently while watching a documentary about the treatment of animals.  It horrified me, leading me to do further research, and since, I haven’t eaten meat.  I’m not trying to criticize anyone who does eat meat—after all, up until about a month ago, I ate meat for 21 years of my life (well, probably not 21, considering that would include my time as a baby without teeth, but you get the point)—but I am trying to present the facts about the meat industry for anyone who is interested in changing their meat consumption habits or just in finding out more about the industry in general.


#### About the Industry
The environments in which the majority of animals used for food are kept are developed with mainly one thing in mind: how to decrease expenses and therefore increase profits.  Most animals are bred to grow larger than what is natural and at abnormally fast speeds, both of which not only cause pain and deformities for the animals, but also further decrease the space in which they are held.  Female pigs, especially while pregnant, are kept in gestation crates, which are typically two feet wide and can cause abscesses, sores, and ulcers.  The small dimensions hinder any movement whatsoever, even the ability to simply turn around, and the filth caused by the slits in the floors that allow manure to fall through to the floors creates an unacceptable setting for the pigs.  Cows, calves in particular, are typically forced to wear heavy chains to restrict movement and are kept in darkness to preserve their pale flesh, which results in anemia. Ninety percent of egg-laying chickens in America are restricted to no more room than a piece of paper, so to keep them from pecking one another to death, some farm operators remove the beaks of chickens, turkeys, and ducks.

The cruelty experienced during the habitation of these animals is practically insignificant compared to the brutality they encounter in the actual slaughtering process. I am not going to include examples of this brutality, because a lot of it is so graphic and horrible, but I will say this: The Humane Slaughter Act was passed in 1958 with the intention of reducing the pain and agony felt by livestock during the process of slaughtering.  It essentially requires slaughterhouses to sedate livestock so they cannot feel the pain of being slaughtered. Although the Act should protect these animals, there are multiple loopholes as well as a lack of adequate monitoring of slaughterhouses.  This law completely leaves out poultry, even though this group makes up over 95% of land animals slaughtered, and it also makes exceptions for religious slaughter such as Kosher and Halal.


I know that some people will always eat meat, and that this type of information will not sway them.  But I also know that some people can and would be changed if they knew this stuff.  That’s what I’m trying to do with this: convince those people.  So, if you’re one of the people who reads this and is affected by it, I urge you to try to cut back on your meat consumption.  If you are interested in doing this, you have <i>tons</i> of options.



#### Ways to Cut Back
If you want to completely cut meat out of your diet, you could try <a href="https://www.vegsoc.org/definition">vegetarianism</a>, and if you want to go even further and cut out all animal products, you could try <a href="https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism">veganism</a>.  Removing meat from your diet can actually lead to <a href="https://www.rd.com/health/healthy-eating/vitamin-deficiency-vegetarian-vegan/">nutrient deficiencies</a> if you're not careful, though, so you need to make sure you're receiving those nutrients elsewhere.   Here are some tips and nutrient-full recipes for <a href="https://issuu.com/vegsoc/docs/new_veggie_guide_v3_forweb">beginner vegetarians</a> and <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/2017/11/14/vegan-tips-for-beginners_a_23276208/">beginner vegans</a>.

If you don't want to adapt a completely meatless diet, you could try "<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/graham_hill_weekday_vegetarian/discussion#t-164483">weekday vegetarianism</a>"—cutting meat out Monday-Friday but eating whatever you like on the weekends—or if that doesn't suit you, you could try "<a href="http://www.meatlessmonday.com/about-us/">Meatless Mondays</a>"—removing meat from your diet once a week, every Monday.  You can experiment with all different kinds of recipes (vegan and vegetarian alike) on your meatless days so you can find out what you like and don't like.  It may not seem like much, but taking meat out of your diet for even one day a week can positively impact both your <a href="http://www.meatlessmonday.com/research/health/">health</a> and the <a href="http://www.meatlessmonday.com/research/environment/">environment</a>. Do it for the piggies!

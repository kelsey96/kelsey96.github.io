# Reusable To-Go Containers and Why You Should Use Them
#### By Kelsey Bales
<br>

 A couple months ago, all 4 of my roommates came back from class at separate times, each with a reusable to-go container instead of their usual compostable to-go boxes.  They said they felt "pressured" into choosing a reusable container that day, and after finishing her meal one even said, "I don't even know what to do with this now," holding up her green box with a look of confusion.  I honestly was glad that I wasn't roped into accepting a reusable container, because—as I (quite notably, <i>incorrectly</i>) thought at the time—who wants to deal with that? But as the condensation from my steaming pasta sauce began slowly soaking my legs through the compostable to-go box I had sitting on my lap, I began to rethink my opinion. I got one the next day for my food, and since then, I haven't turned back.

### What Are Reusable To-Go Containers?
At Virginia Tech, the reusable to-go containers are part of our overall "<a href="https://www.dining.vt.edu/about/Reusable_To_Go_Program.html">Reusable To-Go Program</a>," which is the product of a partnership between VT Dining and the Student Government Association, Housing and Residence Life, and the Office of Sustainability.  They are about the same size and shape as the compostable to-go boxes, but are instead plastic (and green).

 ### How Does It Work?
  The boxes are provided at West End, Owens, and Turner, and kiosks exist at West End, Owens, Turner, and Hokie Grill.Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:



### Benefits
So what's so good about reusable to-go containers?  They help decrease the amount of waste we cause by getting our food-to go, *and* they save you money! They are obviously great for the environment, if people actually use them.  Regular compostable containers—which, by the way, are often not composted and instead end up in landfills—cost you 20 cents apiece for one use, compared to the reusable to-go containers, your first 3 of which are completely free, if you return them!  That means your meal plan money can be spent more on actual food and less on compostable containers.

When you hear "reusable to-go container," what do you think?  As I said earlier, I used to think that they were inconvenient and nothing more than a hassle.  But once I started using them, I realized how great they are.  They save you money, they decrease the amount of landfill waste <i>and</i> waste in your trash cans, and they don't let your food soak through!  Sounds like a great offer to me.  And now, they even offer reusable to-go water bottles!  Food *and* water—what more could you need?

If your school doesn't have a reusable to-go container program, you can work with the Post-Landfill Action Network (PLAN) to start one through this <a href="http://www.postlandfill.org/to-go-guide/">submission form</a>.  If you want to learn more about exactly what this would require, you can find further information in PLAN's "Guide to Setting Up To-Go Container Programs on Your Campus" <a href="http://www.postlandfill.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/togoguide_updated_9_15_AS.pdf">here</a>.

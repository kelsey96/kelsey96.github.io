Reusable To-Go Containers and Why You Should Use Them

 A couple months ago, all of my 4 roommates came back from class at separate times, each with a reusable to-go container.  I was confused not only because none of them had ever used the reusable containers before, but also because they all came back the _same day_ with them.  What a coincidence, right?  My roommate said that she felt "pressured" into choosing a reusable container that day, instead of the regular compostable to-go container, and the other 3 said that they felt that way too.  One of them even said, "I don't even know what to do with this," holding up her green box with a look of confusion.  I thought it was hilarious that they got the boxes to avoid the discomfort of saying no and honestly was glad that I wasn't roped into accepting a reusable container, because--as I (quite notably, _incorrectly_) thought at the time--who wants to deal with that? But as the condensation from the steaming sauce of my pasta began slowly soaking my legs through the compostable to-go box I had sitting on my lap, I began to rethink my opinion.


They are obviously good for the environment, I don't need to tell you that.  They help decrease the amount of waste we cause by getting our food-to go, _and_ they save you money!  Regular compostable containers--which, by the way, are often not composted and actually end up in landfills--cost 25 cents apiece for one use, compared to the reusable to-go container, which is completely free if you turn it back in!

When you hear "reusable to-go container," what do you think?  As I said earlier, I used to think that they were just inconvenient and a hassle to deal with.  But once I started using them, I realized how great they are.  They save you money, they decrease the amount of landfill waste *and* waste in your trash cans, and they don't let your food soak through!  Sounds like a great offer to me.

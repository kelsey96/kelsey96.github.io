# Upcycling: What Is It, Why Should I Care, and How Can I Do It?

#### By Kelsey Bales




About a month ago I was doing a deep clean of my entire apartment, and when I had filled two bags completely to the top, I had a thought: <i>wow, this is a lot of shit</i>.  The bags were filled with the remains of things that my roommates and I would consume on a daily (or weekly) basis—toilet paper rolls, wine corks, tin cans, soda bottles, and more—and then immediately discard after use.  Based on my recollection of a recent video I’d seen on Facebook, I realized that a lot of what was in the trash could probably be <a href="https://www.upcyclethat.com/about-upcycling/">upcycled</a>—repurposed in order to create something new, that often has a completely different purpose from the original item.  I went back to find the video, which I found out was a “Nifty Outdoors” <a href="https://www.facebook.com/buzzfeedniftyoutdoors/videos/332537153889809/">video</a>, and realized I was right: a majority of what I was throwing away could be upcycled.

I did some more research, and what I discovered was that there are tons of ways to upcycle, especially using things that related to the “trash” I was throwing away.  Because of my limited resources as a college student and my somewhat limited crafting skills, I looked for the simplest ideas, but there are tons of other, more advanced ways to upcycle using these items, and tons of other products that can be upcycled.

You’re probably wondering why I cared enough to look this up, and why especially <i>you</i> should  care about upcycling.  It’s probably just another pointless trend that doesn’t even have any impact, right?  Wrong.  Aside from the money-saving benefits (I am a broke college kid, and using things that I’ve already spent money on to make new things is seriously a lifesaver), it’s actually pretty <a href="http://theboxbrand.com.au/repurposed-shipping-containers/5-environmental-benefits-upcycling/">great for the environment</a>.  It decreases the amount of waste in landfill and in turn the amount of greenhouse emissions to the atmosphere, and makes for cleaner waterways, just to name a couple of the benefits.



Here’s a list of ways that you can upcycle common things around your house, no matter how much or how little space you have to spare.  I found tons more, but these are just my favorite:
<ol><li> <a href="https://www.upcyclethat.com/cork-planters/">Cork Planters</a>: When I saw these, I made them almost instantly for my apartment fridge.  How could I resist?  They're just so cute!<br>

<li> <a href="http://www.handimania.com/diy/cans-and-wood-cutlery-holder.html">Cutlery Holder</a>: Not enough space in your silverware drawer?  Try this! </br><img src="https://experthometips.com/images/content/3095-680x476.jpg" height="200"> <br>
<li><a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/272934/dishwashing-liquid-bottles">Dish Soap Holder</a>: Who doesn't have a couple wine bottles lying around?  This is so easy, and can be used for things other than dish soap too, like for different types of oils.</br><img src="https://assets.marthastewart.com/styles/img_240x300/d15/gtgtb_bottles01/gtgtb_bottles01_xl.jpg?itok=O46tODDw" height="250"> <br/>
<li><a href="http://www.homesweethomebodies.net/2010/08/plastic-zipper-bag-to-shower-caddy.html#axzz2mM0w5gAd">Plastic Bag Shower Caddy</a>: This one definitely isn't the prettiest, but it is definitely practical and cheap.<br>

</ol>

As I said before, these are not the only things that can be upcycled, and there are many other ways to upcycle these particular objects as well.  For instance, aside from transforming into a cutlery holder, a tin can can be upcycled into any of the <a href="https://experthometips.com/repurpose-tin-cans-16-wonderful-ways">following</a>, or even more: a cake stand, lantern, planter, drum, wind chime, or pin holder.  The possibilities with upcycling are practically endless; depending on your creativity and determination, almost anything can be repurposed into something of beauty or use.

So next time you're doing a deep clean of your space, or even if you're just tossing one thing into the trash, think about the endless possibilities of new things you could make with it.
